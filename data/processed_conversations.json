I don't even think I might have one maybe with him in it, but I think it was with him and somebody else. But so it's not like a comic book character that I thought I wasn't sure if I would enjoy the movie, but it was very surprising cuz it was probably one of the best the best Marvel movies they've done so far,",

Someone just going to eat McDonald's for I think it was 30 days straight and see what happens to their body afterwards. So it was just intriguing to see what actually happens.",
        "It was okay. The On the plus side, the acting is fantastic, the direction is great, and the imagery is very interesting and innovative. But on the negative side, it's entirely too confusing for its own good, and pretending otherwise is a joke. Like the people said they loved it, I asked them questions, and they couldn't explain anything. So I think it was more It was such a It was such a beautiful film to watch.",
        "I did not enjoy that movie because Home Alone the original and Home Alone 2 star Macaulay Culkin. The third stars a completely different actor who is not as charismatic as Macaulay is, so leaving the movie to just him was a problem. He could not carry off the starring role in the same way, so the first two Like almost everybody else, I consider the first two be Home Alone movies and ignore the rest."
